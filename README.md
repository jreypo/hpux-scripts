hpux-scripts
============

A set of shell scripts from my old times as HP-UX sysadmin. I don't have access anymore to an HP-UX box and because of that the code is currently unmaintained and can be outdated. 

LVM scripts: Three scripts to emulate in HP-UX the behavior of Linux LVM commands lvs, vgs and pvs. Compatible only with HP-UX LVM v1.

- lvs.sh
- vgs.sh
- pvs.sh

Ignite scripts: Two scripts to deploy HP-UX bxes from an Ignite-UX backup or golden image. Written for HP-UX 11iv2 and 11iv3 versions.
