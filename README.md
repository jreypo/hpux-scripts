hpux-scripts
============

<p>A set of shell scripts from my old times as HP-UX sysadmin. I don't have access anymore to an HP-UX box and because of that the code is currently unmaintained and can be outdated</p>
<p><strong>LVM scripts: </strong>Three scripts to emulate in HP-UX the behavior of Linux LVM commands lvs, vgs and pvs. Compatible only with HP-UX LVM v1.</p>

<ul>
<li>lvs.sh</li>
<li>vgs.sh</li>
<li>pvs.sh</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ignite scripts: </strong>Scripts to deploy HP-UX boxes from an Ignite-UX backup or golden image. Written for HP-UX 11iv2 and 11iv3 versions.</p>
