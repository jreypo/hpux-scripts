hpux-scripts
============

<p>A set of shell scripts from my old times as HP-UX sysadmin. I don't have access anymore to an HP-UX box and because of that the code is currently unmaintained and can be outdated</p>
<p>LVM scripts: Three scripts to emulate in HP-UX the behavior of Linux LVM commands lvs, vgs and pvs. Compatible only with HP-UX LVM v1.</p>

<p>- lvs.sh</p>
<p>- vgs.sh</p>
<p>- pvs.sh</p>

<p>Ignite scripts: Scripts to deploy HP-UX boxes from an Ignite-UX backup or golden image. Written for HP-UX 11iv2 and 11iv3 versions.</p>
